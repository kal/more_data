The slipway was western terminal of the Back Ferry and Jean Rocque's 1742 plan shows it with what appear to be steps at its landward end. It still survives, beneath the northern end of O Shed.\r\nThe slipway has a Grade II listing, as part of the whole quay wall."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/more_data/id/dataset/bristolMonumentscsv>.
